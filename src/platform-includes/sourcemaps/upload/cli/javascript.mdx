If you use [`sentry-cli`](/product/cli/) to upload your artifacts, you'll need to be able to generate source maps using your build toolchain.

After you've generated the source maps, you'll need to upload them to Sentry so they can be matched to events. There are two ways of doing this: either by using Debug IDs (preferred), or by using [releases](/product/releases/).

1. The first is to use Debug IDs, which allow Sentry to automatically associate minified sources with their respective source maps without needing to create a release. _This method is the preferred way of uploading artifacts._

2. The second is to use a [release](/product/releases/) to identify the artifacts you uploaded containing all your source files. _This method will require the creation of a release._

Uploading source maps using Debug IDs is the more modern, flexible method. In contrast, uploading using releases, requires creating a release for each change to your application. For example, to see symbolicated errors for an internal development build, you'd need to create a release for that build, which would then show up on the Sentry **Releases** page.

This doc describes both options for uploading source maps.

## Configure Sentry CLI

Make sure Sentry CLI is configured for your project. You can use a `.sentryclirc` file or environment variables:

```ìni {filename:.sentryclirc}
[auth]
token=your-auth-token

[defaults]
org=___ORG_SLUG___
project=___PROJECT_SLUG___
```

```bash
export SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=your-auth-token
export SENTRY_ORG=___ORG_SLUG___
export SENTRY_PROJECT=___PROJECT_SLUG___
```

<Note>

You can find installation instructions for Sentry CLI here: https://docs.sentry.io/product/cli/installation/

For more info on Sentry CLI configuration visit the [Sentry CLI configuration docs](/product/cli/configuration/).

</Note>

<Note>

Visit the [auth token user settings page](https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/) to find your auth tokens.

</Note>

## Upload with Debug ID (Preferred)

Debug IDs are unique identifiers, generated at random by the Sentry CLI, that bind together minified sources and their respective source maps. Each pair of _(minified source, source map)_ will contain the same Debug ID, which will be injected into specific parts of each file.

The generated Debug IDs will be then used by Sentry during processing to understand which source map file to use to symbolicate the stackframes of your event.

### 1. Generate Your Artifacts

To use Debug IDs, you'll have to bundle your code with the `sourcesContent` field in the source map. The generation of the `sourcesContent` will depend on your bundler configuration. Therefore, we recommend looking at the official docs of the bundler your application uses.

Here's an example of what this looks like for webpack:

```javascript {filename:webpack.config.js}
module.exports = {
  ...
  entry: "./src/index.js",
  output: {
    filename: "main.js",
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "build"),
  },
  // Enable "sourcesContent".
  devtool: "source-map",
  ...
};
```

<Note>

The generation of the `sourcesContent` will depend on your bundler configuration, therefore we reccomend you looking at the official docs.

</Note>

### 2. Enable The Debug IDs In Sentry CLI

Since Debug IDs are currently opt-in only, you should enable the following environment variable, which will tell Sentry CLI to use the new Debug IDs system for uploading your artifacts.

```bash
export SENTRY_FORCE_ARTIFACT_BUNDLES=1
```

### 3. Inject Debug IDs Using Sentry CLI

During injection, [`sentry-cli`](/product/cli/) will go over all the minified sources and their respective source maps and it will start adding Debug IDs that are required by Sentry for correctly symbolicating the event.

<Note>

Since Sentry CLI modifies your source files after they are bundled, we currently don't recommend using Debug ID's if your application has [integrity checks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity) in place, or you check for file changes before upload (e.g., on a CDN) based uniquely on their filename.

</Note>

In order to inject Debug IDs you will have to use the new `inject` command:

```bash
sentry-cli sourcemaps inject /path/to/file
```

<Note>

You can verify your injected artifact files by looking at their contents and searching for `debugId` in the minified sources and `debug_id` in the source maps.

</Note>

### 4. Upload Artifacts Using Sentry CLI

Once your artifact files are injected you can proceed to upload them to Sentry, with the `upload` command:

```bash
sentry-cli sourcemaps upload /path/to/file
```

<Note>

You can verify your uploaded artifacts by navigating to **Project Settings -> Source Maps (left sidebar) -> Debug ID Bundles** on Sentry.

</Note>

<Note>

Sentry CLI will notify you in case there are files that don't contain Debug IDs (e.g., you forgot to run the `inject` command). In that case, it will prompt you to weakly associate a release to the artifact. This weakly association is done in order to allow Sentry to properly symbolicate events without Debug IDs.

</Note>

#### Weak Release Association

Sentry requires Debug IDs for fetching the sources used for symbolication but considering that Debug IDs are currently not usable with certain setups (e.g. integrity checks), we extended the new Debug IDs system with the concept of _Weak Release Association_. With such system Sentry will be able to lookup the sources by the `release`, and optionally `dist`, to which they are weakly associated.

The reasoning for the association being weak is that we will not create a release in Sentry under the assumption that you will create the _actual_ release with the same name further on in the pipeline. For this reason, it is important that the name of the `release` you specified during upload will match exactly the name of `release` created via Sentry CLI and/or the `release` in your SDK:
```javascript
Sentry.init({
  // Make sure this value is identical to the name you give the release that specify during upload using Sentry CLI
  release: "<release_name>",
});
```

In order to weakly associate artifacts with a `release` and optionally `dist` you can add new parameters to the `upload` command:

```bash
sentry-cli sourcemaps upload --release=<release_name> --dist=<dist_name> /path/to/file
```

<Note>

If you want to use only the weak release association, there is no need for Debug IDs injection through the `inject` command. However, we strongly reccomend to use the injection if it doesn't cause issues with your existing setup.

</Note>

## Upload with Release (Old)

During this transition phase, we are keeping the old release-based system in place. For that system, Sentry uses [releases](/product/releases/) to match the correct uploaded source maps to your events. You can use `sentry-cli` to create releases and upload source maps to Sentry.

<Note>

We strongly suggest to use the new Debug IDs system for uploading your artifacts since it provides more reliable symbolication and the old release-based system will be faded out in the future.

</Note>

### 1. Update SDK Options

To be able to match Sentry errors with the correct release, you must provide a `release` property in the SDK options:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  // Make sure this value is identical to the name you give the release that you
  // create below using Sentry CLI
  release: "<release_name>",
});
```

### 2. Upload Source Maps Using Sentry CLI

You must first create a release with Sentry CLI. The release name must be unique within your organization:

```bash
sentry-cli releases new <release_name>
```

Next, upload your release artifacts (source files and source maps):

```bash
sentry-cli releases files <release_name> upload-sourcemaps /path/to/files
```

<Note>

You can verify your uploaded artifacts by navigating to **Releases -> [latest release] -> Source Maps (right sidebar)** on Sentry.

</Note>

At this point, the release is in a draft state (“_unreleased_”). Once all source maps have been uploaded and your app has been published successfully, finalize the release with the following command:

```bash
sentry-cli releases finalize <release_name>
```

For more information on how to configure releases via Sentry CLI, see our [Sentry CLI release management docs](/product/cli/releases/).
