If you choose [`sentry-cli`](/product/cli/) as the method to upload your artifacts, we assume you already know how to generate source maps within your build toolchain.

Sentry has two ways of matching the correct uploaded source maps to your events:

1. The first is to use Debug IDs, which allow Sentry to automatically associate minified sources with their respective source maps without needing to create a release. _This method is the preferred way of uploading artifacts._

2. The second is to use a [release](/product/releases/) to identify the artifacts you uploaded containing all your source files. _This method will require the creation of a release._

## Configure Sentry CLI

Make sure Sentry CLI is configured for your project. You can use a `.sentryclirc` file or environment variables:

```ìni {filename:.sentryclirc}
[auth]
token=your-auth-token

[defaults]
org=___ORG_SLUG___
project=___PROJECT_SLUG___
```

```bash
export SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=your-auth-token
export SENTRY_ORG=___ORG_SLUG___
export SENTRY_PROJECT=___PROJECT_SLUG___
```

<Note>

You can find installation instructions for Sentry CLI here: https://docs.sentry.io/product/cli/installation/

For more info on Sentry CLI configuration visit the [Sentry CLI configuration docs](/product/cli/configuration/).

Visit the [auth token user settings page](https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/) to find your auth tokens.

## Upload with Debug ID (Preferred)

Debug IDs are a new feature we have released to account for most of the problems that users were incurring in with the release-based system. Since having events not symbolicated is big problem for our users, we designed Debug IDs to provide a reliable system that would solve the problems people were incurring.

### 1. Prepare Your Bundle

In order to use Debug IDs you will have to bundle your code with the `sourcesContent` field in the source map. This is required by Sentry when processing your events and will lead to problems in the case of absence since the context lines will not be computed.

<Note>

The generation of the `sourcesContent` will depend on your bundler configuration, therefore we reccomend you looking at the official docs.

</Note>

### 2. Enable The Debug IDs In Sentry CLI

Since Debug IDs are currently opt-in only, you should enable the following environment variable, which will tell Sentry CLI to use the new Debug IDs system for uploading your artifacts.

```bash
export SENTRY_FORCE_ARTIFACT_BUNDLES=1
```

### 3. Inject Debug IDs Using Sentry CLI

Debug IDs require an additional but very important step, the injection. In this step, [`sentry-cli`](/product/cli/) will go over all the minified sources and their respective source maps and it will start adding custom metadata that is required by Sentry for correctly symbolicating the event.

<Note>

Debug IDs injection will modify the content of both your minified sources and source maps which will create issues if you have integrity checks in place or you check for file changes before upload (e.g., on a CDN) based uniquely on their filename. _We are currently working on improving the injection system in order to circumvent these problems._

</Note>

In order to inject Debug IDs you will have to use the new `inject` command:

```bash
sentry-cli sourcemaps inject /path/to/file
```

<Note>

You can verify your injected artifact files by looking at their contents and searching for `debugId` in the minified sources and `debug_id` in the source maps.

</Note>

### 4. Upload Artifacts Using Sentry CLI

Once your artifact files are injected you can proceed to upload them to Sentry, with the `upload` command:

```bash
sentry-cli sourcemaps upload /path/to/file
```

<Note>

You can verify your uploaded artifacts by navigating to **Project Settings -> Source Maps (left sidebar) -> Debug ID Bundles** on Sentry.

</Note>

<Note>

Sentry CLI will notify you in case there are files that don't contain Debug IDs (e.g., you forgot to run the `inject` command). In that case, it will prompt you to weakly associate a release to the artifact. This weakly association is done in order to allow Sentry to properly symbolicate events without Debug IDs.

</Note>

#### Weak Release Association

Since Debug IDs might cause issues for some users, we extended the new Debug IDs system with the concept of _Weak Release Association_. With such system you are able to tell Sentry to weakly associate the artifacts you upload with a `release`, and optionally `dist`.

The reasoning for the association being weak is that we will not create a release in Sentry under the assumption that you will create the _actual_ release with the same name further on in the pipeline. For this reason, it is important that the name of the `release` you specified during upload will match exactly the name of `release` created via Sentry CLI and/or the `release` in your SDK:
```javascript
Sentry.init({
  // Make sure this value is identical to the name you give the release that specify during upload using Sentry CLI
  release: "<release_name>",
});
```

In order to weakly associate artifacts with a `release` and optionally `dist` you can add new parameters to the `upload` command:

```bash
sentry-cli sourcemaps upload --release=<release_name> --dist=<dist_name> /path/to/file
```

## Upload with Release (Old)

During this transition phase, we are keeping the old release-based system in place. For that system, Sentry uses [releases](/product/releases/) to match the correct uploaded source maps to your events. You can use `sentry-cli` to create releases and upload source maps to Sentry.

<Note>

We strongly suggest to use the new Debug IDs system for uploading your artifacts since it provides more reliable symbolication and the old release-based system will be faded out in the future.

</Note>

### 1. Update SDK Options

To be able to match Sentry errors with the correct release, you must provide a `release` property in the SDK options:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  // Make sure this value is identical to the name you give the release that you
  // create below using Sentry CLI
  release: "<release_name>",
});
```

### 2. Upload Source Maps Using Sentry CLI

You must first create a release with Sentry CLI. The release name must be unique within your organization:

```bash
sentry-cli releases new <release_name>
```

Next, upload your release artifacts (source files and source maps):

```bash
sentry-cli releases files <release_name> upload-sourcemaps /path/to/files
```

<Note>

You can verify your uploaded artifacts by navigating to **Releases -> [latest release] -> Source Maps (right sidebar)** on Sentry.

</Note>

At this point, the release is in a draft state (“_unreleased_”). Once all source maps have been uploaded and your app has been published successfully, finalize the release with the following command:

```bash
sentry-cli releases finalize <release_name>
```

For more information on how to configure releases via Sentry CLI, see our [Sentry CLI release management docs](/product/cli/releases/).
